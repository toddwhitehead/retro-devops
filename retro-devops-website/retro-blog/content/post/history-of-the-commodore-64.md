The Commodore 64 (C64) is an 8-bit home computer introduced in January 1982 by Commodore International. The combination of clever technology and innovative sales strategies helped to make it the highest-selling single computer model of all time with independent estimates placing the number sold between 10 and 17 million units. The C64 dominated the low-end computer market for most of the 1980s and introduced a whole generation of people to the idea of a home computer.
This long and successful run made it attractive to software developers with approximately 10,000 commercial software titles released for the C64 including development tools, office productivity applications, and (most importantly) video games.
